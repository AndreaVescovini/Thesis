\section{Introduction}
The backward facing step is a widely-used test configuration in which a 
turbulent flow in a channel encounters separation because of a sudden 
enlargement; in Figure \ref{fig:bfs_glimphs} the velocity field is represented.

	\label{fig:bfs_glimphs}
\end{figure}
We want to use this case to validate the results of our 
$k\text{-}\omega$ model, comparing them with experimental results from 
\cite{driver} and numerical results from \cite{sitonasa}.

\section{The test}
The domain is chosen as in Figure~\ref{fig:bfs_domain}, with a step height $H = 
\SI{1}{m}$. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{bfs_domain}
	\caption{Domain of the backward facing step test.}
	\label{fig:bfs_domain}
\end{figure}
The following boundary conditions are imposed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item On the wall boundary $\Gamma_w$ we set no slip conditions for the 
	velocity 
	$\mathbf{v}$, a homogeneous Dirichlet condition for the turbulent kinetic 
	energy $k$ and a Dirichlet condition for the turbulent variable $\omega$ 
	such that:
	\begin{equation*}
	\omega = \frac{6 \nu}{\beta_\omega l_w^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\beta_\omega$ is a constant equal to 0.0708 and $l_w$ is the 
	distance from the wall. This formula implies that $\omega \rightarrow \inf$ 
	as $l_w \rightarrow 0$, so it is imposed at the centre of the cells that 
	touch the wall to avoid infinite values.
	%
	\item On the inflow boundary $\Gamma_{in}$ we set a Dirichlet condition for 
	the velocity, imposing a flat profile $\mathbf{v} = [U_{in}, 
	0]^\mathrm{T}$. For $k$ and $\omega$ we impose Dirichlet conditions such 
	that:
	\begin{equation} \label{bc:ko}
	k = \frac{3}{2} (U_{in}I)^2, \quad \omega = \frac{k^{1/2}}{C_{\mu}^{1/4}L}
	\end{equation}
	where $I = 0.16 Re^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ is the turbulence intensity, $C_\mu = 
	0.09$ and $L = \alpha H$ is a turbulence length scale, with 
	$\alpha = 0.07$.
	%
	\item On the outflow boundary $\Gamma_{out}$ we set a zero-gradient 
	condition for the velocity and a Dirichlet condition for the pressure $p = 
	p_{ext} = \SI{1.1e5}{Pa}$. For $k$ and $\omega$ we impose 
	Dirichlet conditions analogous to 
	\eqref{bc:ko}.
\end{itemize}

Notice that with respect to \cite{sitonasa} we do not use any symmetry 
condition near the inlet of the channel, but we start suddenly with a wall. For 
this reason we have adapted the length of the channel before the step in order 
to obtain at the position $x/H = -1$ a boundary layer thickness of $1.5H$, as 
it 
is in \cite{driver} and \cite{sitonasa}. In this way we have a correct velocity 
profile before the step.

In order to reproduce the results from \cite{driver} and \cite{sitonasa} we 
need 
a Reynolds number based on the step height of approximately 36000. Therefore we 
choose 
$U_{in} 
= \SI{44.2}{m/s}$ as in \cite{driver}, $\varrho = \SI{1}{kg/m^3}$ and $\mu 
= \SI{1.228e-3}{\pascal\second}$.

The results are adimensionalized using the step height $H$ as reference length 
and the velocity near the centre of the channel at $x/H = -4$ as a reference 
velocity $U_{ref}$.

For what concerns the time discretization we simulate the time interval $[0, 
T_{end}]$, with $T_{end} = \SI{30}{s}$. At approximately $t = \SI{20}{s}$ a 
stationary solution is reached, then we compare the results at $T_{end}$. We 
start the simulation with $\Delta t = \SI{e-5}{s}$, the the time 
step is adapted depending on the convergence of the Newton method at the 
previous time iteration.

\section{Grid analysis}
Several grids with different numbers of cells and different gradings have been 
tried. In order to compare the results we have compared the velocity profiles 
before and after the step, at $x/H = -4$ and $x/H = 1$, and the friction 
coefficient $C_f$ after the step. $C_f$ is a dimensionless form of the stress 
at the wall as is it defined by:
\begin{equation*}
C_f = \frac{\tau_w}{\frac{1}{2}\varrho U_{ref}^2}
\end{equation*}
In out case when $C_f < 0$ the flow is recirculating, so from its value we can 
predict the point where the flow \emph{reattaches}, as $C_f$ becomes positive; 
according to \cite{sitonasa} this is a relevant information about the 
reliability of the simulation.\\
The numerical reference predicts the reattachment near $x/H=6.8$; the 
experimental measure of the reattachment position was $x/H = \num{6.26+-0.10}$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item With coarse mesh the reattachment point was lower, a refinement of 
	the smallest cell in the $y$ direction was needed.
	\item Too stretched cells leaded to problems in the Newton convergence.
	\item I could coarsen cells in the $x$ direction in the downstream portion 
	of the channel.
	\item A refinement of the cells in the $y$ direction in the recirculation 
	area was useless.
\end{itemize}
\section{Results comparison}
The following results are obtained with a grid made of \num{121 x 70} cells, 
employing gradings up to 1.25 in order to better refine the grid near the 
walls. In general we have obtained a good agreement with the numerical solution 
from \cite{sitonasa}, in particular the Van Leer result is better than the 
Upwind one.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The position of main eddy is slightly anticipated, the profile at 
	$x/H = 1$ is that one that the reference has at $x/H = 1.2$ or something 
	like that, we can see it also from the $C_f$ plot.
	% 
	\item However the reattachment point is almost the same, but looking at the 
	$C_f$ plot is seems that out eddy is a bit bigger.
	%
	\item For the upwind this behaviour is enhanced, showing in the test plot 
	different results. (Reattachment point and small eddies in the $C_f$ plot)
	%
	\item Experimental results are sometimes different, in particular in the 
	velocity profiles near the wall at $x/H=6$ and $x/H=10$.
	%
	\item The value of $C_f$ going to the end of the channel.
