\chapter*{Aknowledgements}
A thanks to the German Research Foundation (DFG) for the funding within the interdisciplinary Collaborative Research Centre SFB 1313.

I thank prof. Formaggia and prof. Scotti for having shown me the possibility of carrying on my thesis in Stuttgart and having helped me to catch it.
I thank prof. Helmig, that during my six months of scholarship has helped me a lot with his infinite passion and enthusiasm.
I thank all the members of the department LH$^2$ for the great time spent there in such a friendly and stimulating environment, always willing to implement a new feature in \DUMUX but also to bake a cake for the colleagues. In particular I thank Ned and Melanie, that have supervised my work and were always positive about how it was going and ready to discuss together the last developments.

Infine un ringraziamento speciale a tutti gli amici che hanno condiviso con me questi anni di università per i bei momenti passati insieme, alla mia famiglia, per aver sempre supportato le mie scelte, e a Valeria, che crede sempre in me e mi è sempre vicina.
