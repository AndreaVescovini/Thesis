\chapter{Numerical results} \label{chap:results}
%We have made a lot of computations.
\section{Navier-Stokes tests}
\subsection{Convergence of the TVD methods}
%We have a better convergence.
\subsection{Convergence with respect to time}
\subsection{Rough channel test}
%Here we see some differences.
\section{RANS tests}
\subsection{Backward facing step}
%A good benchmark.
\subsection{Cavities reciprocal influence}
%An easy result.
\section{Coupled test}
\subsection{Cavities coupled with the porous-medium}
%A more complex result.
