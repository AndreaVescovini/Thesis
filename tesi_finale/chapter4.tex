\chapter{Numerical results} \label{chap:results}
In this chapter we present some numerical results. The convergence of higher 
order methods applied to the Navier-Stokes equations is tested, first in space, 
then in time. Then another spatial comparison test between the upwind method 
and the TVD methods is performed using a channel flow. After that the results 
from the backward facing step test using the RANS equations are shown and 
compared to those from the CFL3D code \cite{web:nasa}. Next, a turbulent 
channel flow with two small cavities is studied and at last a coupled free-flow 
and porous-medium flow problem is analysed, varying the permeability of the 
porous-medium.\\
In all the tests the gravity has been neglected.

\section{Navier-Stokes tests}
\subsection{Space convergence} \label{subsec:conv}
We want to test the spatial convergence order of the $L^2$-error of the 
solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, comparing the results obtained with 
the upwind method \eqref{eq:upwind} and the TVD methods described in 
Subsection~\ref{subsec:tvd}.\\
We consider a steady version of the 
equations~\eqref{eq:nsmass}--\eqref{eq:nsmom}:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:nssteadymass} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} -h = 0&\\
	\label{eq:nssteadymom} \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{v} \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T}) - 
	\nabla \cdot (\nu \nabla \mathbf{v}) + \frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p  
	-\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{0}&
\end{align}
We neglect the gravity, but we take into account two possible source terms 
$h$ and $\mathbf{f}$. Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, we consider here 
all the quantities appearing in the equations to be non-dimensional.
%
\subsubsection{Sin-Cos test}
Let us solve the equations~\eqref{eq:nssteadymass}--\eqref{eq:nssteadymom} over 
a two-dimensional unit domain $\Omega=(0,1)^2$, with the following source terms:
\begin{align}
	h &= 0,\\
	\mathbf{f} &= [-2\nu \cos(x) \sin(y), \; 2\nu \cos(y) \sin(x)]^\mathrm{T},
\end{align}
so that, choosing $\varrho=1$, the analytical solution, depicted in 
Figure~\ref{fig:sincosexact}, is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:uexsin}	u_\text{ex}(x,y) &= -\cos(x)\sin(y)\\
	v_\text{ex}(x,y) &= \sin(x)\cos(y)\\
\label{eq:pexsin}	p_\text{ex}(x,y) &= -\frac{\cos(2x)+\sin(2y)}{4}
\end{align}
Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity are applied on the whole 
boundary $\partial \Omega$ using the exact solution. Because of this choice, 
the pressure appears in the problem only in the momentum equation 
\eqref{eq:nssteadymom}, under the sign of gradient. Thus in the numerical 
solution it would be defined up to a constant, so we fix its value at one point 
in the domain in order to match the exact solution \eqref{eq:pexsin}.

The problem is solved over a sequence of five uniform grids, starting from 
$\num{4x4}$ cells and each time halving their size. Both the cases of $\nu=1$ 
and $\nu=\num{e-3}$ are considered, that correspond to $Re=1$ and $Re=\num{e3}$ 
respectively. In Figure~\ref{fig:sin_err} the errors computed are reported 
depending on the square root of the number of cells, while in 
Tables~\ref{tab:sin_lre}--\ref{tab:sin_hre} we can compare directly the 
convergence orders for the different differencing schemes.

\end{table}

We observe, as expected, a better behaviour of the TVD methods with respect to 
the upwind method. In Table~\ref{tab:sin_lre} we can see that at $Re=1$ the 
formers show a full second order convergence for the velocity, while for the 
rate is a bit lower; the latter instead shows a first for all the variables. At 
$Re=\num{e3}$ a slight decrease of the rates of the TVD methods occurs also for 
the velocities, but they remain higher then the ones of the upwind method. In 
Table~\ref{tab:sin_hre} we observe a convergence order of 1 for the pressure 
using the Van Leer flux limiter, but looking at Figure~\ref{fig:sin_err} we can 
see that the global trend indicates a convergence of higher order. Moreover it 
can be observed how, thanks to the faster convergence, on the same grid the 
absolute values of the errors reach smaller values using the TVD methods. 
Between the Min-Mod and Van Leer flux limiter it is hard to say which performs 
better, the results are very similar.

Analogous tests with other analytical solutions are reported in the 
Appendix~\ref{app:conv}. They show always a better convergence of the TVD 
methods with respect to the upwind method, but in some cases the convergence 
order of pressure and velocity behave differently.
%
\subsection{Time convergence}
We test the time convergence of the $L^\infty(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ norm of the 
error of the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, comparing the results 
obtained with the BE method \eqref{eq:be} and the BDF2 method \eqref{eq:bdf2}.\\
We consider the unsteady version of the 
equations~\eqref{eq:nssteadymass}--\eqref{eq:nssteadymom}:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:nsunsteadymass} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} -h = 0&\\
	\label{eq:nsunsteadymom} \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} +\nabla 
	\cdot (\mathbf{v} \mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T}) - 
	\nabla \cdot (\nu \nabla \mathbf{v}) + \frac{1}{\varrho}\nabla p  
	-\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{0}&
\end{align}
Again the gravity is neglected and two possible sources $h$ and $\mathbf{f}$ 
are taken into account, moreover all the quantities are considered to be 
non-dimensional.
%
\subsubsection{Unsteady Sin-Cos test}
Let us solve the equations~\eqref{eq:nsunsteadymass}--\eqref{eq:nsunsteadymom} 
over a two dimensional unit domain $\Omega=(0,1)^2$ and in the time interval 
$(0,T)$, with $T=1$. We use the following source terms:
\begin{align}
h &= 0,\\
\mathbf{f} &= 2\Big(\frac{\cos(2t)}{\varrho} + \nu \sin(2t)\Big)[- \cos(x) 
\sin(y), \; 
\cos(y) \sin(x)]^\mathrm{T},
\end{align}
so that, choosing $\varrho=1$, the analytical solution is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:uexunssin}	u_\text{ex}(x,y) &= -\cos(x)\sin(y)\sin(2t)\\
v_\text{ex}(x,y) &= \sin(x)\cos(y)\sin(2t)\\
\label{eq:pexunssin}	p_\text{ex}(x,y) &= 
-\frac{\cos(2x)+\sin(2y)}{4}\sin^2(2t),
\end{align}
so it is equal to \eqref{eq:uexsin}--\eqref{eq:pexsin}, used in the steady test 
for the space convergence, except for the modulation over time. We choose 
$\nu=0.1$, so that $Re=10$. Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity are 
applied on the whole boundary $\partial \Omega$ using the exact solution. 
Pressure is again fixed  at one point in order to match the exact solution 
\eqref{eq:pexunssin}.

The problem is solved seven times subdividing the time interval $(0,T)$ into 
uniform time-steps and each time time doubling their number, starting from a 
single time-step. Uniform grids of $\num{40x40}$ and $\num{80x80}$ cells are 
employed and as a differencing scheme the TVD method with the Van Leer flux 
limiter \eqref{eq:vl} is used. From Figure~\ref{fig:timeerr} we observe that, 
as expected, the BE method shows a first-order convergence, while the BDF2 
method is of second order. Moreover we notice that, with a grid of 
$\num{40x40}$ cells, in the last refinement the error with the BDF2 method does 
not decrease anymore. This happens because the spatial error becomes 
dominant, indeed refining the grid the convergence order is restored entirely 
for the pressure and almost for the velocity.

\section{RANS tests}
\subsection{Backward facing step}
%The NASA LaRC CFD code CFL3D uses:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item free-stream turbulence intensity = 0.061\%
%	\item free-stream turbulent viscosity (relative to laminar) = 0.009
%	\item in this case the simulations were \emph{quasi-steady}, i.e. the 
%	solution does not converge readily to a steady state result when a refined 
%	grid is used. However, when run-time accurately, the solution settles down 
%	and becomes reasonably steady (quasi-steady).
%	\item The code is for compressible flows at ``essentially incompressible" 
%	conditions of M=0.128. There may be a very small influence of 
%	compressibility.
%	\item non-dimensional CFD code
%	\item first order turbulence advection in the turbulence transport equations
%	\item Neglects two terms that are zero for incompressible flows
%	\item implicit time advancement (also second order)
%	\item Central differencing in Space? Non lo dice cosa usa, inoltre secondo 
%	me non usa una staggered grid.
