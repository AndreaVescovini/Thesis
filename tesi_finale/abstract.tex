Exchange processes between free-flows and porous-media flows are common in many 
industrial and environmental applications. In the case of turbulent flows and 
rough interfaces an accurate description of the free-flow is important because 
the turbulent eddies near the interface strongly affect the exchanges.

The aim of this thesis is thus the application of high resolution schemes for 
the finite volumes discretization of the convective term in the momentum 
equation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In particular the focus 
is on the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) methods. They have been implemented 
in the code \DUMUX, within the framework of a staggered grid approach. Two 
possible extension to the case of non-uniform grids have been considered.

Several comparison tests with the first order upwind methods have been 
performed, showing more accurate solutions for the TVD methods on the same grid.
Afterwards the RANS equations have been used in order to simulate turbulent 
flows, employing the $k\text{-}\omega$ turbulence model. The backward facing 
step test has been used to validate the results against the 
ones from the NASA CFL3D code. A good prediction of the reattachment length has 
been obtained. At last a coupled free and porous-medium configuration has been 
studied, with focus on the effect that a shaped interface has on the flow 
field. The porous-medium flow has been modelled using the Forchheimer's law.
